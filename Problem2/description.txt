Throughout this description, a term p is said to be of higher degree than term q
if p appears to the left of q in a sorted polynomial.

Compare is a helper function which compares the degree of two terms.

For addition, since each polynomial is sorted, we have one pointer for each 
polynomial which only move to the right. At any time, the higher of the two
terms pointed to by p1 and p2 (if they don't have the same degree) is appended 
to the result, and that corresponding pointer is shifter do the right. If the 
terms have same degree, then they are merged into one term whose coefficient is 
the sum of the two coefficients. In case the sum is zero, this term is deleted
from the result.

For multiplication, the first term of A is multiplied with all B and stored in 
result. Then, the second term of A is multiplied with each term of B (from left 
to right), and after each multiplication, the term obtained is inserted into
result in the appropriate place. If the degree of the new term matches the 
degree of an existing term in result, the two terms are combined. This procedure
is carried out for each term of A to obtain the product polynomial.
